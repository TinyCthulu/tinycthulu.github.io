## An exploration into the cursed nature of the procedural detective game.

> In this post, we will explore the *[cursed](https://youtu.be/8uE6-vIi1rQ?t=273)* nature of the procedurally generated detective game. We will deconstruct some of the more interesting challenges along the way, and by the end, we will come out with a deeper insight into the problem as a whole.

## **Introduction**

I have always loved procedural police dramas on TV, particularly those involving a clever detective. A well done procedural has a narrative that is bound to draw you in with witty humor, an intriguing mystery, and a juicy twist. My only real problem with the format is actually a problem with the *mystery* genre as a whole.

Once you know the secret twist or solution, the mystery loses it's magic. It can be difficult to re-experience. Don't get me wrong, a clever story with interesting characters and well-written dialogue will stand on its own two feet the first time and the hundredth time. In that sense a classic mystery is no different from any other story. It's why we can still revisit the tales of popular characters like Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot, or the infamous Shawn Spencer from the TV show Psych. But, unlike most other *kinds* of stories, the *unknown* plays a disproportionate role in the mystery genre. 

The interesting thing about suspense is that it does not exist in the pages of a book, within the characters on a stage, or inside the pixels on a screen. It exists solely in the mind, in the individual experiences of the audience. The opportunity to solve the puzzle *with* the characters on screen is arguably the main appeal of any mystery. If *you*, the audience, already know the outcome, then the journey can quickly lose its suspense and become a chore to rehash.

But what if there was some way to to keep the *mystery* in the mystery?

Enter the *Procedural Procedural*. Video games and other interactive media provide us with the unique opportunity to augment the traditional mystery formula. More specifically, they offer the ability for the audience to *become* the detective and interact directly with the investigation. What's more fascinating is that, in theory, it is possible to take the "traditional mystery formula" and use it to procedurally generate a mystery in *real time*.

There is a phrase, "What is easy to say, is hard to do." I can't think of a better candidate than, "procedurally generate a mystery in real time." As easy as that is to say, it does prove to be a rather difficult premise to tackle.

In this post, we will explore the *[cursed](https://youtu.be/8uE6-vIi1rQ?t=273)* nature of the procedurally generated detective game. We will deconstruct some of the more interesting challenges along the way, and 
by the end, we will come out with a deeper insight into the problem as a whole.

## **Exploration**

 There are *already* hundreds of procedural detective games. Some are good and some are bad, but most share a problem that is, more or less, unique to the detective game genre. In order to break down a "Procedural Procedural", we will have to address not only the broader features of the *mystery genre*, but also specific *detective game* related problems. The first of which being, primarily narrative driven experiences, particularly detective games, tend to suffer from their own "game-ness".

It's nobody's fault that games want to be games, but there is something to say about the inverse relationship between mechanics and narrative. Player agency is all about the ability to make meaningful choices. Unfortunately a strong reliance on narrative structure diminishes the opportunity for meaningful choices.

Therein lies the rub.
