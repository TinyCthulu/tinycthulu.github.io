## An exploration of the *cursed* nature of the procedural detective game.

# **Introduction**

I have always loved procedural police dramas on TV, particularly those involving a clever detective. A well done procedural has a narrative that is bound to draw you in with witty humor, an intriguing mystery, and a juicy twist. My only real problem with the format is actually a problem with the *mystery* genre as a whole.

The problem with mystery is that, once you know the secret twist or the solution the story loses it's magic. It can be difficult to *"re-experience"* said mystery because the unknown element, and therefore the suspense, has been removed. Don't get me wrong, a clever story with interesting characters and well-written dialogue will stand on it's own two feet the first time and the hundredth time. In that sense a classic mystery is no different from any other story. It's why we can still revisit the tales of popular characters like Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot, or the infamous Shawn Spencer from the TV show Psych. But, unlike most other kinds of stories, the *unknown* plays a disproportionate role in the mystery genre. 

The interesting thing about suspense is that it does not exist in the pages of the book, within the characters on stage, or inside the pixels on screen. It exists solely in the mind, in the individual experiences, of the audience. The opportunity to solve the puzzle *with* the characters on screen is arguably the main appeal of any mystery. If *you*, the audience, already know the solution, then the journey there can quickly become a chore to rehash.

But what if there was some way to to keep the *mystery* in the mystery?

Enter the *Procedural Procedural*. Video games and other interactive media provide us with the unique opportunity to augment the traditional mystery formula. More specifically, they offer the ability for the audience to *become* the detective and interact directly with investigation. What's more is that, in theory, it is possible to take the *"traditional mystery formula"* and use it to procedurally generate a mystery in *real time*. As easy as that is to say, it does prove to be a rather difficult premise to tackle.

In this blog, we will explore the *[cursed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uE6-vIi1rQ)* nature of the procedurally generated detective game. We will deconstruct some of the more interesting challenges along the way, and hopefully, by the end, we will come out with a deeper insight into the problem as a whole.

# **Exploration**

Now, there are already hundreds if not thousands of procedural detective games. Some are good and some are bad, but most share a problem that is, more or less, unique to the detective game genre. Along with the broader issues present in all mysteries, detective games tend to suffer from their own *game-ness*. It's nobody's fault that video games want to be games. It does mean, however, that there is something about games that can detract from the narrative experience as a whole. I would argue that most detective games fail as mysteries due to their greater focus on mechanics instead of narrative.
