## An exploration into the elements of a procedurally generated mystery.

## **Introduction**
In my last post we took a look at [the cursed nature of the procedurally generated detective game]({% post_url 2020-04-19-the-procedural-procedural-pt-I %}). In this post we will be taking a look at the fundamental elements of a mystery and how to use them to procedurally generate one.

## **Exploration**

I am going to be using this great article from Master Class about the about [The 10 Essential Elements of a Mystery Story](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/essential-elements-of-a-mystery-story#what-is-mystery-fiction) as a jumping off point. I know the article itself mentions 10 elements, but I only want to focus on a handful of them.

### **1. A Crime**
> A crime is the event that fuels the plot in a mystery novel. Revealed in the first chapter, a crime creates the central conflict that launches the investigation, sending the main character on their quest and spurring the narrative arc.

Like the article states, the crime is the central conflict of the story.

### **1a. A Sleuth**
> At the heart of every mystery is a main character determined to solve the crime. Mystery writer Raymond Chandler created private detective Philip Marlowe to be a crime solver in his novels. A writer can raise the stakes by making the detective personally invested in solving the crime. Mysteries can center around an amateur investigator—an average citizen who solves the case. The character development of the sleuth is important; they need a backstory that connects them to the crime or the killer, and a motive that explains why solving this crime is important to them.

### **1b. A Villain**
> A mystery is often called a whodunit because the culprit is unknown until they’re caught at the end. The story follows their movements, which propel the story forward. The main character and the reader discover the criminal’s identity as the plot reaches its climax.

### **2. A Trail of Clues**
> Clues are the literary element that allows mystery stories to engage readers on a deeper level than other types of fiction. The reader becomes an amateur sleuth, following the trail of clues to try to discover the identity of the culprit. When writing mysteries, an author needs to have an organized writing process in order to keep track of what clues they’re creating, when they appear, and who knows what in order to make sure the plot lines make sense.

### **2a. Foreshadowing**
> Mysteries often drop hints of things that will happen in the future. This is known as foreshadowing. A writer can hint at a future event with a small clue or through character dialogue. Writers can be more or less direct with foreshadowing, either subtly hinting at future events or explicitly stating what will happen.

### **2b. Red herrings**
> A good mystery throws the reader off track. Red herrings are an essential element in mysteries. These false clues build tension by creating other suspects and distracting the detective—and the reader—and leading them away from the real culprit. A writer creates red herrings by placing extra emphasis on an object, event, or character that catches a reader’s attention, making that element seem more significant than it really is to the storyline. In Agatha Christie’s And Then There Were None, there are 10 characters who are all potential suspects. Christie creates red herrings by killing off each character one by one, creating plot twists that send the reader into new directions in search of the killer.
