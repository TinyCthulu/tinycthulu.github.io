# **Who is tinycthulu?**
My name is Shawn McGee. I am 22. I love games. I love my wife. And I love programming.

I have been programming since before I even owned a computer, and I have worked with Flash, Batch, VBS, TIBasic, Java, HTML, CSS, JS, C++, and C#. I have tried and failed to run my own Indie Game Studio, and I have more flopped projects than finished ones. Despite flop after flop, mistake after mistake, I still find myself having fun every step of the way. Programming for me has always been an endless adventure.

# **Why Program for Fun?**
 My journey starts when I was 12 or 13 when one summer, I picked up *Macromedia Flash for Dummies*. I remember walking to the library and spending hours on a public PC hacking away in script editor. At the time, I was involved in lots of creative pursuits at home, at school, and through other public programs. Until then, I had never experienced what it was like to breathe life into those artistic projects and I was absolutely hooked.

 I had always been a games enthusiast in the classical sense. I was a phenomenal STEM student with a strong grip on abstract mathematical concepts, and I could beat most of the adults I knew in games like Chess, Checkers, and Monopoly. My brother and I were interested in making board games of our own, copying what worked in other games and discarding what didn't. We didn't just look at the mechanics of these board games; however, we were fascinated by the intricate worlds some of these games presented (my favorite example being *Hero Scape*).

 Until now, we didn't have much experience with computers, consoles, or interactive media of any sort. Every game we played, every story we told was driven by some kind of human agent. They were static and unresponsive, bound to the limitations of our own minds and bodies. At the end of the day, when it was time to leave our world, we had to come to terms with the fact that we were not a part of it. We were merely puppeteers.

Around the same time, my brother and I bought our very own Xbox 360 along with a copy of *Halo: Reach* (IMHO one of the best *Halo* games, and unfortunately the last one that *Bungie* had a hand in making). I remember being completely drawn into the world of Noble Team as they slowly lost their home world to the imminent Covenant threat. I felt the pain of leaving George behind in *Long Night of Solace*, I cried when Kat died in *New Alexandria*, and I fought to save my home until I couldn't anymore in *Lone Wolf*. For the first time, I had the opportunity to not just pretend, but instead to be.

TLDR; Interactive media is fun, but it is also easily one of the most impactful and immersive forms of storytelling that has ever existed. As a programmer, I have the fantastic opportunity to marry diverse technical and creative elements from every discipline.

# **What's next?**
Like always, I plan to continue on my iterative adventure of try-fail-repeat. Each step, learning from my mistakes and not only growing as a developer, but as a problem solver and as a person.

As far as future projects are concerned, I still have so many ideas, and hopefully many years to see them become fully realized. [Stay tuned](http://tinycthulu.com) to learn more about current and upcoming projects.
