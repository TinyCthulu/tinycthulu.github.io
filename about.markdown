## **Who is tinycthulu?**
My name is Shawn McGee. I am 22. I love games. I love my wife. And I love programming.

I have been programming since before I even owned a computer, and I have worked with Flash, Batch, VBS, TIBasic, Java, HTML, CSS, JS, C++, and C#. I have tried *and failed* to run my own Indie Game Studio. Despite having more flops than an NVIDIA GPU, I still find tremendous joy in programming for fun.

## **Who is this blog for?**
This blog is "A place for all the thoughts in my head."; a personal journal open to anyone. I feel obligated to disclaim that I am *not* an expert. I am however, ravenously curious, and in this blog I plan to share my exploration into the wonderful world of programming and design.
